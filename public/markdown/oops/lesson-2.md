# Object-Oriented Programming: Class Diagram Exercise

In this exercise2, you'll create a class diagram for a simple animal hierarchy.

## Instructions

1. Create an `Animal` class with the following properties and methods:
   - `name` (String)
   - `age` (int)
   - `makeSound()` (method)

2. Create two subclasses of `Animal`:
   - `Dog` with an additional `breed` property and `bark()` method
   - `Cat` with an additional `color` property and `meow()` method

3. Establish the inheritance relationships between the classes.

Use the Mermaid editor to create your class diagram. Good luck!
