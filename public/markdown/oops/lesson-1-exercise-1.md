## Exercise 1: Vehicle Rental System

### Requirements:
A vehicle rental system manages different vehicles. Each vehicle has a model name, registration number, type (car, bike, etc.), and rental status (available or rented). Vehicles should have behaviors such as being rented and being returned.


## How to Approach These Exercises

1. **Understand the Scenario**: Carefully read the requirements to understand the problem.
2. **Identify the Class**: Determine the main entity (e.g., `Vehicle`, `Dish`) to be modeled as a class.
3. **Define Properties**: List the attributes that describe the entity.
4. **Define Methods**: Identify the behaviors or actions the entity should perform.

These exercises will help reinforce your understanding of classes and their structure. Happy coding!
