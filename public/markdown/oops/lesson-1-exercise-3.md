## Exercise 3: Hospital Patient Management

### Requirements:
A hospital manages patient records. Each patient has a name, age, medical record number (MRN), and current status (admitted, discharged). Patients can be admitted or discharged based on their status.

## How to Approach These Exercises

1. **Understand the Scenario**: Carefully read the requirements to understand the problem.
2. **Identify the Class**: Determine the main entity (e.g., `Vehicle`, `Dish`) to be modeled as a class.
3. **Define Properties**: List the attributes that describe the entity.
4. **Define Methods**: Identify the behaviors or actions the entity should perform.

These exercises will help reinforce your understanding of classes and their structure. Happy coding!
