## Exercise 5: Smart Home Device Management

### Requirements:
A smart home system manages devices. Each device has a name, type (light, thermostat, etc.), status (on or off), and a room where it is located. Devices should have behaviors to turn on or turn off.

## How to Approach These Exercises

1. **Understand the Scenario**: Carefully read the requirements to understand the problem.
2. **Identify the Class**: Determine the main entity (e.g., `Vehicle`, `Dish`) to be modeled as a class.
3. **Define Properties**: List the attributes that describe the entity.
4. **Define Methods**: Identify the behaviors or actions the entity should perform.

These exercises will help reinforce your understanding of classes and their structure. Happy coding!
