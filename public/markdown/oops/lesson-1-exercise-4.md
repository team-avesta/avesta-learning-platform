## Exercise 4: E-Learning Platform

### Requirements:
An e-learning platform manages courses. Each course has a title, instructor, duration (in hours), and enrollment status (open or closed). Courses should have behaviors such as opening or closing enrollment.

## How to Approach These Exercises

1. **Understand the Scenario**: Carefully read the requirements to understand the problem.
2. **Identify the Class**: Determine the main entity (e.g., `Vehicle`, `Dish`) to be modeled as a class.
3. **Define Properties**: List the attributes that describe the entity.
4. **Define Methods**: Identify the behaviors or actions the entity should perform.

These exercises will help reinforce your understanding of classes and their structure. Happy coding!
