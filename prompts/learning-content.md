#learning content

I am creating a learning platform for teaching Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design to beginners who have no prior knowledge of OOP. The platform supports Mermaid diagramming and requires all examples to include Mermaid code to help users visualize concepts.

Please generate learning content for the 'Class'. Here are the requirements for the content:

Audience: The content is for absolute beginners. Concepts should be explained in simple, easy-to-understand language.
Structure: The content should be structured as follows:
Definition/Explanation: What the concept is and why it matters.
Detailed Examples: Use at lease 5 real-world software engineering examples to illustrate the concept. First explain the requirements in details and then identify class with their properties and methods also explains why you defined all the details about each class, properties and methods so that students can understand easily.
Mermaid Diagrams: Provide Mermaid class diagram code to help users visualize the relationships and structure.
Focus on Clarity: Avoid technical jargon unless it is necessary and explain all terms thoroughly.
Markdown Format: The content must be formatted in Markdown, as it will be directly imported into the platform.
No Exercises: Do not include exercises in the content. Exercises will be created separately.
The content should focus only on the topic provided and be tailored to it. 


#excercise

I am designing an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) learning platform for beginners. Based on the concept of 'Class,' generate exercises to help students practice designing classes. The exercises should follow these guidelines:

Scenario Description:

Provide a real-world scenario as the basis for the exercise.
Clearly define the requirements, such as the entity to be modeled, its properties (data), and behaviors (methods).
The requirements should be written in simple language to ensure clarity for beginners.
Solution:

Provide the solution for the exercise in the form of a Mermaid class diagram.
Include all properties and methods in the class.
Ensure the Mermaid code is correct and matches the requirements.
Output Format:

Structure the output in Markdown format.
Use headers to separate the scenario description and solution.
The solution must be formatted as a Mermaid code block for class diagrams.
Focus:

Ensure the exercises are practical and help students understand the concept of a class.
Avoid advanced topics or additional concepts (e.g., inheritance or polymorphism) unless explicitly asked.
