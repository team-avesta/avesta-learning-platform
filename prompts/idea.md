I am creating a learning and exercise platform for the software development domain.

The platform will have the following features:

1. A personalized dashboard for each user that displays the user's progress and performance.
2. A course catalog that includes a wide range of courses for different skill levels and interests.
    1. The courses will be created by the platform's team and will be updated regularly.
    2. Main courses will be OOPs design, Database Design, Cloud Design etc.
    3. Each course will have multiple modules, each module will have multiple lessons.
    4. Each lesson will have an exercise.
    5. Each exercise will be a design exercise that the user can practice.
        1. The user will be given a design challenge and will have to design the solution.
        2. The user will have to write the code in the mermaid syntax for the solution. System will show the live preview of the diagram.
        3. The user will have to submit the solution.
        4. The user can view the explanation of the solution and the correct mermaid code.
